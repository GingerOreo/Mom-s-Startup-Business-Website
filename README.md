# Mom-s-Startup-Business-Website
This is a website I'm building for my mom's food business. I'm currently a Grade 12 student in the Philippines learning web development in preparation for eventual Computer Science, so this is a learning project as much as it is a business project.

## Current Status
- [x] Basic HTML structure
- [x] CSS styling
- [ ] Dynamic Content  
- [ ] Contact form with backend
- [ ] Product catalog
- [ ] Payment integration

## Tech Stack
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Still learning haha)
- [Backend tech when I get there]

## Learning Goals
- Practice full-stack development (For now)
- Learn to deploy a real website
- Get comfortable with version control

## Contributing
I'm open to suggestions and pull requests! Since I'm learning, I'll review each PR carefully to understand what's being changed and why. Feel free to open issues with feedback or questions. I am also open to chats!

## Note
This is beginner code and actively being improved. If you're also learning, feel free to learn alongside me!
